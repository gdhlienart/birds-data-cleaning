This project analyzes bird observation data to practice initial data cleaning and exploration skills (see jupyter notebook). It includes datasets on bird sightings, biologists, and bird species attributes. 


**Datasets**

	•	observations.csv: Contains data on bird sightings, including date, location, and time spent observing.
	•	biologists.csv: Includes information on the biologists conducting the observations, such as their specialization and experience.
	•	birds.csv: Provides characteristics of bird species observed, such as species name, color, and average wingspan.
